# SeaDrive: The Shell for ZoraNT
Welcome to **SeaDrive**, the brand-new shell designed exclusively for ZoraNT. Our goal with SeaDrive is simple: create a versatile and powerful shell that will ***never become obsolete***. With the ability to seemlesly add integrations thanks to `flipper` alongside a robust help menu included, not only is **SeaDrive** easy to use, but the ability to customize it is limitless.
## Features
- **Modern Shell Design**: Built from the ground up with a focus on performance and extensibility.
- **Future Proof**: SeaDrive is engineered to remain relevant and adaptable over time, ensuring it evolves alongside ZoraNT.
- **Git Integration**: Easily install updates from GitHub repositories using the `pull` command. In addition, being able to download entire repositories using `tetra`.
## Usage
Simply double click and it opens![^1] As with any CLI, I always recommend running the `help` command to help you get started.
